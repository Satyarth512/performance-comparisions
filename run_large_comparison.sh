echo "1. PYTHON MULTIPROCESSING PERFORMANCE:"
echo "   ‚úì Best result: 1.10x speedup (prime calculation)"
echo "   ‚úó Often worse than single-threaded due to overhead"
echo "   ‚úó GIL still prevents threading benefits"
echo ""
echo "2. JAVA THREADING PERFORMANCE:"
echo "   ‚úì Shows true parallelism when task size justifies it"
echo "   ‚úì 2-65x faster raw performance than Python"
echo "   ‚úì Consistent and predictable scaling"

echo "3. SCALING ANALYSIS:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Python: Even with larger tasks, limited by GIL"
