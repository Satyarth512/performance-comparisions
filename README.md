## 🧪 Test Categories

### 1. Mathematical Operations
CPU-intensive trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, sqrt) to test pure computational performance.

### 2. Prime Number Calculation
Classic CPU-bound algorithm that tests algorithmic performance and scaling.

### 3. Fibonacci Computation
Recursive mathematical operations to test function call overhead and computation.

## 🎯 Test Configurations

Each benchmark runs in multiple configurations:

- **Single-threaded**: Baseline performance
- **Multi-threaded**: 4-10 threads/processes depending on available cores
- **Python-specific**: Both threading and multiprocessing variants

## 📈 System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- 2+ CPU cores
- 4GB RAM
- Java 11+
- Python 3.7+

### Recommended for Best Results
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8GB+ RAM
- Java 17+ (for latest optimizations)
- Python 3.9+ (for improved multiprocessing)

## 🔍 Understanding the Results

### Why Java Performs Better

1. **No Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Java threads can truly run in parallel
2. **Superior JVM optimizations**: Decades of performance tuning
3. **Efficient threading model**: Lower overhead for thread creation and management
4. **Better CPU utilization**: Can effectively use all available cores

### Python's Limitations

1. **GIL bottleneck**: Only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time
2. **Multiprocessing overhead**: Process creation and IPC costs
3. **Serialization costs**: Data must be pickled/unpickled between processes
4. **Memory duplication**: Each process needs its own memory space

## 📝 Customizing Tests

### Adjusting Workload Size

Edit the constants in the test files:

**Python:**
```python
ITERATIONS_PER_THREAD = 10_000_000  # Increase for heavier workload
```

**Java:**
```java
private static final long ITERATIONS_PER_THREAD = 100_000_000L;
```

### Changing Thread Count

**Python:**
```python
NUM_THREADS = multiprocessing.cpu_count()  # Or set manually
```

**Java:**
```java
private static final int NUM_THREADS = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
```
